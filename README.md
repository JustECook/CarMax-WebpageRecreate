# CarMax-WebpageRecreate
A mock website intended to replicate CarMax's home page

Purpose for Build: 

This project was done to refresh skills in HTML and CSS. It was a challenge getting to simply look at a webpage and attempt to recreate the look without viewing the source code. The exercise forced me to think more about how I place items within divs and which classes I select for them. 

About the project files:

There is (1) html document
There is (1) External CSS stylesheet
There is an image folder which contains potential background images as well as the CarMax logo
There is (1) image file representing the web page background

Future upgrades/modification: 

1. This page only shows the top of the original website. The goal will be to add a few more features to make it even more like the original. This includes interactive buttons.

I welcome any feedback :)
